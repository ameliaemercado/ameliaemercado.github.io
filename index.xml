      <description>0. Introduction: The two data sets that I chose were Happy and Countries. The Happy data set contains the Happiness Rank of a country as calculated by the World Happiness Report in 2017. Freedom represents the magnitude of freedom recorded by some measure, and Economy GDP is a scaled measure of a countries GDP in the year of 2017. The Countries data set contains the Region that a country is in, its Surface Area in km^2, and Population density as of 2017, which shows the number of inhabitants per square kilometer.</description>
