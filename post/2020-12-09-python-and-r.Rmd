## In this blog post, I am going to be sharing some neat things you can do with python. 
## 1. You can create a list or a string: 
```{python}
list1 = "5, 6, abc, 10, amelia, cool" 
print(list1)
string1="Happy Birthday to my friend Chloe"
print(string1)
```

## 2. You can use regex to find certain things in a string: 
```{python}
import re
string2= "amelia was born in Gulfport, MS, on Jan 20, 2000."
re.findall(r"[0-9]+", string2) #finds numbers 
re.findall(r"\w{6}\s", string2) #find my name (6 letters with a white space) 
```

## 3. You can import datasets and play around with the data: 
```{python}
import pandas as pd 
heart=pd.read_csv("heart.csv")
heart.head() 

import numpy as np
heart.trestbps.min() #find min of chol variable 
heart.trestbps.max() #find max of chol variable  
median=heart.chol.median() 
heart[heart.chol>median].trestbps.mean() #find mean of resting bp when cholesterol is above the median 
heart[heart.chol<median].trestbps.mean() #find mean of resting bp when cholesterol is below the median 
```
##. 
```{r}
