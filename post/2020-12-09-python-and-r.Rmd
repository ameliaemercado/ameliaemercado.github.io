## In this blog post, I am going to be sharing some neat things you can do with python. 
## 1. You can create a list or a string: 
```{python}
list1 = "5, 6, abc, 10, amelia, cool" 
print(list1)
string1="Happy Birthday to my friend Chloe"
print(string1)
```

## 2. You can use regex to find certain things in a string: 
Here, I am having regex find the numbers and also my name. 
```{python}
import re
string2= "amelia was born in Gulfport, MS, on Jan 20, 2000."
re.findall(r"[0-9]+", string2) #finds numbers 
re.findall(r"\w{6}\s", string2) #find my name (6 letters with a white space) 
```

## 3. You can import datasets and play around with the data: 
Here, I am showing how to import datasets in python and also how to find certain descriptives such as median, min, max, and mean.    
```{python}
import pandas as pd 
heart=pd.read_csv("heart.csv")
heart.head() 

import numpy as np
heart.trestbps.min() #find min of chol variable 
heart.trestbps.max() #find max of chol variable  
median=heart.chol.median() 
heart[heart.chol>median].trestbps.mean() #find mean of resting bp when cholesterol is above the median 
heart[heart.chol<median].trestbps.mean() #find mean of resting bp when cholesterol is below the median 
```

## 4. You can also make python and R talk to one another!:
Here is an R code chunk, where I load the dataset called `mpg`. 
```{R} 
library(reticulate) 
library(ggplot2)
m <- mpg  
head(mpg)
```

Here is a python code chunk, where I load the dataset that I called `m` in R. 
```{python} 
r.m.model.head() 
```
You can go back and forth between R and python, just make sure to put `py` before something in R if you ran it in python, and `r` before something in python if you ran it in R! 

## I am no master at python, but I have to say, I stay loyal to R ğŸ˜Œ
